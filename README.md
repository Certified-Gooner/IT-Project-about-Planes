So basically, this is just a little startup project for myself that I created for a project in my IT class. 
This project focuses on 3 major Aircraft manufacturers: Boeing, Airbus & Lockheed Martin. 
The files have Informations about the aircraft models (newer versions) and pictures of them.
The main page (Flugzeug-INFO-Projekt - Kopie) has three <a href=""> links leading to the remarked websites.
As of today 29-11-2024, it has no CSS whatsoever. I am planning to include some CSS into the project.
As a beginner I may make frequent and silly mistakes, so if you see any, please correct me.
